\section{Verification Reports}

Needs a intro paragraph here


A tech note is created for each verification event setting the standard for verification execution and results.  Each verification tech note includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Annotations in the EFD to timestamp the start and stop of a particular test when running from a notebook or script
	\item Document timestamps in test case of the start and stop of a particular test when running manually from a EUI
	\item Document all deviations or anomalies in the execution of the test case, such as needing to stop and then restart, execute in a different order, etc.
	\item Document the actual results of the steps beyond just marking the step as pass or fail.
	\item Generate Bug, FRACAS tickets for issues or failures that arise during verification
	\item Generate plots, analysis results, link to raw data sources
	\item All testers should attend verification planning meeting to ensure they are knowledgeable about how to perform the tests
	\item Testers should provide feedback on how to improve the procedures
	\item Develop a Jupyter notebook template that shows how to structure the notebook and how to create annotations
	
\end{itemize}

Formal detailed records of verification done by Rubin Observatory is in Jira LVV project with reported published to lsst.io as SCTR and DMTR with an archive in DocuShare as well.
