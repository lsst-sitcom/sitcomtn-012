The IT Chile team confirms that they use three platforms for documentation (aside from DocuShare):

\begin{itemize}

	\item The ITTN tech note series here:\url{https://www.lsst.io/ittn/}. Note:  IT is are actively moving from writing Confluence pages to using ITTN documents more and more.
	\item READMEs of their GitHub repositories in \url{https://github.com/lsst-it/}. For example, https://github.com/lsst-it/k8s-cookbook contains procedures for standing up and operating various Kubernetes clusters.
	\item Confluence; primarily motivated by day-to-day communications exchange with the commissioning and camera teams.
	
\end{itemize}
