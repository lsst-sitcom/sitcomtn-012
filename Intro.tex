\section {Introduction}

As part of the second objective of \url{LSE-489.lsst.io}, this document represents the work of the Rubin Observatory Documentation Working Group in their survey of sources for construction and operations critical information and documents.  These sources include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item DocuShare;
	\item TechNotes from \url{lsst.io};
	\item Confluence Pages;
	\item Engineering Models; 
	\item GitHub Repositories;
	\item System-wide Databases;
	\item Verification Reports;
	\item Education and Public Outreach; 
	\item Information Technology; and
	\item Individual Storage; Slack Chat and Personal Repository Spaces.
\end{itemize}
	
There are additional document categories under development and continuous content updates to documents by Construction, Pre-operations and Operations Teams at the time of releasing \url{SITCOMTN-012.lsst.io}. This document may be revised to include updates to sources and documents as they are developed and matured; but this is not required. These include procedures for standard operations, regular maintenance, servicing and repair.
